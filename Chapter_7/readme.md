>Please explain the difference between puts and print in your own words in the Readme.md.

Puts or put string, does exactly that, and continues to do so until there are no more. Multiple puts will return all of the 
strings at once, separated only by line numbers. Print on the other hand, serves as a break and will only output to one line.
