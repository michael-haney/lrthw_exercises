>Do you like string interpolation or format strings?  Why?

Because I am still novice at coding, I prefer string interpolation as setting each variable separately, is easier to understand and follow.
On the other hand, format strings I feel will be my preferred method in the future because it is faster and more succinct. Also, it gives you the ability to define
multiple variables.
