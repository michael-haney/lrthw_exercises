#Chapter 2: Learn Ruby the Hard Way

>Can you find a key combo in RubyMine to comment out a line of code? 

On https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/help/keyboard-shortcuts-you-cannot-miss.html, I found a shortcut for #. Simply, you can press `command /` to comment out a whole line.

>Did you get any errors from Rubocop?

I did. Rubocop complained about these use of double quotes where single quotes should be applied.
I made the necessary adjustments and satisfied Rubocop.
