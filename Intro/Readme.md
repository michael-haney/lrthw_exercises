##Questions:

> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

Reading and writing - Being able to code and distinguish between less commonly used characters is the base of programming.
Attention to detail - Paying attention to details is paramount to running smooth, bug-free code.
Spotting differences - Spotting differences makes it easy notice mistakes, bugs, and other problems.

>Why do you need to not copy and paste?

We don't copy/paste because it takes away from the thought process and practice behind learning.

>Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Practicing will help transfer what we learn from our short term memory to our long term and working memory. Persistance is important because we will innevitably face challenges and difficulties. If we just give up, we stop learning.
