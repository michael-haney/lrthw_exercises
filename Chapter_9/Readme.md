#Chapter 9

> What does \n do within double quotes?

The \n will make the code puts to a separate line for each \n within double quotes.

>Rubocop complaints

Rubocop complained about the use of three double quotes on lines 9 and 13. Rubocop prefers single quotes and
wanted me to combine the lines. I did so with the use of one pair of single quotes. When doing this however, the space between
output of Aug and 'There's something going on here.' disappeared. Hence, I had to include an empty puts on line 9.
