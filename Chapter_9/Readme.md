#Chapter 9

> What does \n do within double quotes?

The \n will make the code puts to a separate line for each \n within double quotes.

>Rubocop complaints

Rubocop complained about the use of three double quotes on lines 9 and 14. Rubocop prefers single quotes and
wanted me to combine the lines, however Rubocop also complained about the use of three single quotes. I fixed this by using one pair of double quotes.
